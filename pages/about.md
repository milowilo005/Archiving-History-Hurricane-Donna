Hurricane Donna, regarded as the most devestating storm of the 1960 Atlantic hurricane season, impacted the South of Florida immensely.

The Southwestern region was not the only area affected either. The storm impacted the Keys, as well as areas of Cuba and Puerto Rico before it made landfall near Naples, Florida. The Fort Myers News-Press, now known as the News-Press, published a newspaper just days before Donna hit, detailing how residents prepared for the coming storm by stocking up on supplies, dismissing school, and evacuating danger zones. The newspaper also mentions the fact that Hurricane Donna was the first major hurricane that threatened Florida since the year 1947.

Following up a few days after the storm, the Fort Myers News-Press published another newspaper to update about the initial detrimental impacts of and responses to Donna. The billions of dollars in damages, President Eisenhower’s response, the storm's impact on the New England area, and the climbing death toll were highlighted on the front page.

Collier County was among the few areas most affected by the storm, especially concerning storm surge and flooding. This photograph, taken by an unknown/unnamed photographer, captures the flooding of a neighborhood in Everglades City.

This article, written by an unknown author, details further about the devastation of Donna and the public’s view of the storm on a much more personal level. Many personal accounts of individual people’s experiences, from Collier County residents to officers that were on duty at the time of evacuation, are included in order to support the author's claim that “Donna was the worst storm we ever had.”

The impact of Donna did not end there, and the effects were felt in Southwest Florida for many years afterwards. The photograph above captures a sign in the Gordon Fish Camp of Naples, a staple of the fishing community in the area before it was shut down due to the damage done by the 1960 hurricane. Instances such as these left a lasting impact on Florida and its communities.

In April of 1961, the Florida State Board of Health, now known as the Florida Department of Health, published an installment of “Florida Health Notes” that gave a further look into the potential long-term public health concerns caused by Hurricane Donna. These included a lack of access to clean water that occurred for a while after the storm and an influx in rodent and reptile infestations in shelters and homes. There was plenty said on the efforts done by organizations like the Salvation Army to feed and treat all sorts of injuries and ailments post-storm as well. 

Even after nearly 65 years, the lasting effects of Hurricane Donna makes it a storm to be remembered. It had broken around 12 years of hurricane-free peace, devestated three different countries, and changed the lives of countless individuals. While it may not be close to being the most dangerous or strongest hurricane seen by Southwest Florida, it certaintly made a name for itself.
